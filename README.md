## Submission for Crossmint's coding challenge - Samuel Ballesteros
Parkour to the moon!
## Steps to run

1. Ensure you have `node` installed (my version was v20.1.0)
2. Clone repo
3. Run program with `node index.js`

Note: Ran into a bug where after completing the challenge I couldn't load the map anymore. I did not want to call the DELETE endpoints since I do no know if it would break the challenge somehow and was advised to submit as it. 

I would have liked to convert the program to typescript just to add return types and make things a bit neater. My `generateParams`function could probably also be shortened a a little.
